## üöÄ What's Been Added

Your Siren app has been successfully converted to a Progressive Web App (PWA) with the following features:

### ‚úÖ Core PWA Features
- **Web App Manifest** (`/public/manifest.json`) - Defines app metadata, icons, and behavior
- **Service Worker** (`/public/sw.js`) - Handles caching, offline functionality, and push notifications
- **PWA Meta Tags** - Added to `index.html` for proper mobile app behavior
- **Install Prompt** - Shows when users can install the app
- **Offline Indicator** - Shows when users are offline

### üé® PWA Components
- `PWAInstall` - Install prompt component
- `OfflineIndicator` - Shows offline status
- `usePWA` - Custom hook for PWA functionality

### üì± App Features
- **Standalone Mode** - App runs in full-screen without browser UI
- **Offline Support** - Core functionality works without internet
- **Push Notifications** - Emergency alerts and safety notifications
- **App Shortcuts** - Quick access to emergency features
- **Responsive Design** - Works on all device sizes

## üîß Next Steps

### 1. Generate Icons
Run the icon generation script:
```bash
node scripts/generate-icons.js
```

This will show you how to convert the SVG icon to PNG files. You need these icon sizes:
- 72x72, 96x96, 128x128, 144x144, 152x152, 192x192, 384x384, 512x512

### 2. Create Shortcut Icons
Create these additional icons for app shortcuts:
- `emergency-96x96.png` - Red emergency icon
- `report-96x96.png` - Document icon  
- `dial-96x96.png` - Phone icon

### 3. Set Up Push Notifications (Optional)
To enable push notifications:

1. Generate VAPID keys:
```bash
npm install -g web-push
web-push generate-vapid-keys
```

2. Update the VAPID public key in `client/hooks/usePWA.ts`:
```typescript
applicationServerKey: urlBase64ToUint8Array('YOUR_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY')
```

3. Set up server-side push notification handling

### 4. Test PWA Features

#### Development Testing:
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Production Testing:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

#### PWA Testing Tools:
- Chrome DevTools > Application > Manifest
- Chrome DevTools > Application > Service Workers
- Lighthouse PWA audit
